 # The City Rat And The Country Rat

_A_ city rat, one night,<br>
Did, with a civil stoop,<br>
A country rat invite<br>
To end a turtle soup.<br>

Upon a Turkey carpet<br>
They found the table spread,<br>
And sure I need not harp it<br>
How well the fellows fed.<br>

The entertainment was<br>
A truly noble one;<br>
But some unlucky cause<br>
Disturb'd it when begun.<br>

It was a slight rat-tat,<br>
That put their joys to rout;<br>
Out ran the city rat;<br>
His guest, too, scamper'd out.<br>

Our rats but fairly quit,<br>
The fearful knocking ceased.<br>
'Return we,' cried the cit,<br>
To finish there our feast.<br>

'No,' said the rustic rat;<br>
'To-morrow dine with me.<br>
I'm not offended at<br>
Your feast so grand and free,<br>

'For I've no fare resembling;<br>
But then I eat at leisure,<br>
And would not swap, for pleasure<br>
So mix'd with fear and trembling.'<br>
