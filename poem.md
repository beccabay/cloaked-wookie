# The City Rat And The Country Rat

     _A_ city rat, one night,
     Did, with a civil stoop,
     A country rat invite
     To end a turtle soup.

     Upon a Turkey carpet
     They found the table spread,
     And sure I need not harp it
     How well the fellows fed.

     The entertainment was
     A truly noble one;
     But some unlucky cause
     Disturb'd it when begun.

     It was a slight rat-tat,
     That put their joys to rout;
     Out ran the city rat;
     His guest, too, scamper'd out.

     Our rats but fairly quit,
     The fearful knocking ceased.
     'Return we,' cried the cit,
     To finish there our feast.

     'No,' said the rustic rat;
     'To-morrow dine with me.
     I'm not offended at
     Your feast so grand and free, 

     'For I've no fare resembling;
     But then I eat at leisure,
     And would not swap, for pleasure
     So mix'd with fear and trembling.'
